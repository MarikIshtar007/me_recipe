## Misc

The app uses sqflite package to create a sql-based database locally that stores and manages the recipe database. Storing a recipe allows storing its name, picture, ingredients list and procedure. 

The app is a personal project and follows multiple architectures.. because it is fun.... such as MVVM, with the help of the get_it package

**P.S. APK is available in the repositories' release section**
